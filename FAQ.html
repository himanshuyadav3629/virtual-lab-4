    <br>
    <p>
        1) How can I access the Virtual Labs? <br>
All Virtual Labs can be accessed through a common website. At the user end, a PC/Smartphone and broadband connectivity enables the user to access Virtual Labs. <br><br>
2) How I can find a lab of my interest?<br>
The Virtual labs are divided into two categories on the Virtual Labs home page
Discipline Wise
Institute Wise
The user can click on any of the categories to find out the lab of his preference. The user can also search for the virtual labs on the home page itself. There are two search options:-
Search by the name of the Virtual Lab: Here the user can type in the name of the virtual lab of his preference from any Institute or Discipline.
Search by Discipline: Here the user can choose the discipline of his preference from the drop down menu. After searching the desired Virtual lab, the user has to make a single click on the link, which would take him to that particular Lab-specific home page. This method of accessing the virtual lab is common to all the Labs available on the Virtual Labs homepage. <br><br>
3) Is it free to use?<br>
Yes, it is free of cost to the user. <br><br>
What are the software requirements for Virtual Labs? <br>
The Virtual Labs do not require any specific software. Few labs that have software dependency will have a free downloadable link to that software. <br><br>
4) When can we use the Virtual Labs? <br>
Virtual Labs can be accessed and used at anytime and anywhere with the help of the system and internet connection. The simulation-based labs are available 24x7, including weekends. <br><br>
5) What do I do if I am stuck? <br>
The users can email their queries to the Virtual Labs support team at ayush.a.singh@slrtce.in
<br><br>
6) How do I register for using the Virtual Labs? <br>
The user can directly perform the experiment. On the other hand, some of the simulation virtual labs require registration, for which the user can go to the respective website and do a one-time registration. <br><br>
7) How do I derive the maximum benefit from Virtual Labs? <br>
To derive a maximum learning experience, the users are advised to first read all the instructions for conducting the labs. There are 'step-by-step' instructions available in each lab to assist the users. <br><br>
8) I already have a Physical Lab in my college/institute. What benefit will Virtual Lab provide?<br>
Virtual Lab is a complete Learning Management System. All the relevant information, including the theory, lab manual, additional web resources, video lectures, animated demonstrations, and self-evaluation, are available at a single place. Virtual Labs can be used in a complementary fashion to augment the efficacy of theory-based lectures. Virtual Labs can be effectively used to give lab demonstrations to large classes. <br><br>
9) How to enroll as a Nodal Centre? <br>
Institute can enroll as a Nodal Centre by submitting an Expression of Interest (EOI) form which is available on the website under the heading of Become a Nodal Centre. The filled EOI can be submitted to the support email id i.e.,  ayush.a.singh@slrtce.in
